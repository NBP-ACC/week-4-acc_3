Code Review by Jan for Group 4

parameter_list.py:
- in line 82 you should have used the variable directory instead of using PATH+'/Data', which adds some redundancy. You can concatenate the relative path with os.path.join()
- Furthermore, you could leave out the if, if you used os.makedirs() with parameter exist_ok=True
See here for further info: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/os.html#os.makedirs


main_experiment.py
in writeData(), line 84:
- The naming is not done perfectly as asked by the task: argument subID in writeData has to include 'Sub' to follow the naming convention Sub[subID].csv. You could have used something like "Sub{}.csv".format(subID)
- Nice solution to just write the pandas-dataframe as a csv-file!

For working with git, it is always encouraged to use very clear commit messagees and rather do small commits with one purpose than a single huge commit after you finished your work. I say that, because "TAH_sub1_sub2_main_para" is not a very clear description of what the changes were.


Good overall code structure!
